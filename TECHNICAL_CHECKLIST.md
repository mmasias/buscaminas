# Technical Assessment Checklist

## Code Review Completed ✅

### Files Analyzed:
- [x] `src/masiasManuel/Juego.java` - 9 lines
- [x] `src/masiasManuel/Buscaminas.java` - 9 lines

### Assessment Criteria Evaluated:

#### 1. Code Compilation & Syntax ✅
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Proper Java syntax
- [x] Package declarations correct

#### 2. Code Structure & Architecture ⚠️
- [x] Basic class structure present
- [x] Main method implemented
- [x] Separation of concerns (Juego vs Buscaminas)
- [ ] Internal class design (missing)
- [ ] Data structures (missing)

#### 3. Functionality Implementation ❌
- [ ] Game board representation
- [ ] Mine placement logic
- [ ] User input handling
- [ ] Game state management
- [ ] Win/lose conditions
- [ ] Game loop
- **CRITICAL**: `jugar()` method is completely empty

#### 4. Requirements Compliance ❌
Based on README.md requirements:
- [ ] 6x6 board grid
- [ ] 6 random mines
- [ ] Despejar (D) action
- [ ] Marcar (M) action
- [ ] Coordinate system (row, column)
- [ ] Console interface
- [ ] Victory conditions
- [ ] Defeat conditions

#### 5. Code Quality Standards ⚠️
- [x] Java naming conventions
- [ ] Code documentation
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] Code comments

#### 6. Best Practices ⚠️
- [x] Package structure
- [ ] Encapsulation (no private members)
- [ ] Method decomposition
- [ ] Constants usage
- [ ] Exception handling

### Assessment Documentation Created:
- [x] Detailed technical analysis: `VALORACION_CODIGO_MASIASMANUEL.md`
- [x] Executive summary: `ASSESSMENT_SUMMARY.md`
- [x] Technical checklist: `TECHNICAL_CHECKLIST.md`

### Final Recommendation:
**MAJOR REWORK REQUIRED** - Code is structurally sound but functionally empty. Requires complete implementation of game logic.

**Estimated Implementation Time**: 8-12 hours for full functionality.
